**Attribute Meta-data**
A uniform taxonomy of characteristics that may be associated with an Attribute and where such characteristics are deemed necessary or appropriate to effect or enable the use of the value. Such information may establish its validity period, or more generally define constraints or tags that effect the use of the value.

**Entity Meta-data**
A collection of Attribute Meta-data which apply on a specific entity version.  

**Entity Meta-data Context**
A collection of Attribute Meta-data which apply on a specific entity. Generally its an instance of entity meta-data.
But, it could be an aggregation of entity meta-data.

urn:dowsers:{meta entity reference}:identity@{identity attribute}

**Attribute Reference**

urn:dowsers:{meta entity reference}:{attribut name}@{entity identity attribute}

**Meta Entity Context Provider**

h1. Entity


An entity is defined by:
* An unique identity. Her identity does not change when any of its attributes change
* A set of attributes

Examples: Customer, Order, Organization, Car ...
 
Attributes are characteristics of entities


h2. Identity

Wikipedia's entry on the philosophical meaning of identity starts:

In philosophy, identity is whatever makes an entity definable and recognizable, in terms of possessing a set of qualities or characteristics that distinguish it from entities of a different type. Or, in layman's terms, identity is whatever makes stuff the same or different.

h2. What is a value object (an attribute) ? 

“A Value Object cannot live on its own without an Entity.”
 
Eric Evans:
“An object that represents a descriptive aspect of the domain with no conceptual identity is called a VALUE OBJECT. VALUE OBJECTS are instantiated to represent elements of the design that we care about only for what they are, not who or which they are.” 
[Evans 2003]
