How to check out a specific branch from github

git clone git://github.com/...[path to your project]...git

git branch -a
...to see what branches you have. One of the lines you see might be:
remotes/origin/[NameOfYourBranch]

In order to start a local branch, based on that remote branch, and switch to it, go:
git checkout -t -b [NameOfYourBranch] remotes/origin/[NameOfYourBranch]
